Where do you come from?

I come from the fertile mind of my botmaster, Peter.

You:

what is the most interesting response?

Chomsky: 

That is a personal matter. You must decide for yourself.

You:

What is the most peculiar response?

Chomsky: 

I think it is a tie.

You:

asdfghjkl

Chomsky: 

That doesn't make sense!'
